# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture / Bootcamp Overview and Introduction to Cloud Spend
## Technical Tasks
In the class, we are going to lay out the foundation for the entire bootcamp by:
```
ðŸ‘‰ Discussing the format of the bootcamp
ðŸ‘‰ Going over the business use-case of our project
ðŸ‘‰ Looking at an architectural diagram of what we plan to build
ðŸ‘‰ Showcase how to use Lucid Charts to build architectures
ðŸ‘‰ Talk about C4 Models
ðŸ‘‰ Running through the cloud services we will utilize
ðŸ‘‰ Testing that we can access our AWS accounts
ðŸ‘‰ Settings up AWS free-tier and understand how to track spend in AWS --> eg . AWS Budgets, AWS Cost Explorer, Billing Alarms
ðŸ‘‰ Understanding how to look at monthly billing reports
ðŸ‘‰ Launching AWS CloudShell and looking at AWS CLI
ðŸ‘‰ Generating AWS credentials
```
## Business Scenario
```
Your company has asked to put together a technical presentation on the proposed architecture that will be implemented so it can be reviewed by the fractional CTO.

Your presentation must include a technical architectural diagram and breakdown of possible services used along with their justification.

The company also wants to generally know what spend we expect to encounter and how we will ensure we keep our spending low.
```

## Highlevel Architecture /CI CD Pipeline Considerations (Well Architecture Framework Inspired):
### To architect a Twitter Clone/Similar Microservice Application on AWS, the following steps should be considered:

ðŸ‘‰ Define the requirements and scope of the application: To start with, need to finalize on defines requirements of your application, such as how many users to handle, how many posts per second, handling followers and followees etc. This will help you determine the right components and services to use in your architecture

ðŸ‘‰ Choose a load balancer: To handle/distribute the incoming traffic (may be evenly) to your application, could use an Amazon ELB or Amazon ALB to balance the load between multiple instances of microservices

ðŸ‘‰ Content Delivery Network (CDN): To serve media files, such as images and videos, could use Amazon CloudFront to distribute the content closer to the end-user for faster delivery

ðŸ‘‰ Cache: To improve the performance of your application, you can use Amazon ElastiCache for in-memory caching

ðŸ‘‰ Decide on a database: Could choose to use a relational database like Amazon RDS or a NoSQL database like Amazon DynamoDB depending on use case and requirements to store user information and posts. If large amounts of data, may want to consider using Amazon S3 or Amazon Glacier for long-term data storage

ðŸ‘‰ Monitor and scale the application: Could use Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon Auto Scaling to monitor application and scale it as needed to handle changing traffic patterns. Also could use Amazon ECS or EKS to monitor and manage the performance of your application. This will help identify and resolve issues quickly, ensuring the reliability and availability of the application.

ðŸ‘‰ Application instances: To handle incoming requests, can have multiple instances of application running in Amazon EC2 or Amazon ECS depending on budget/requirements

ðŸ‘‰ Data model: Design the data model: Create a data model that defines the data that needs to be stored in each microservice, as well as the relationships between the data. This will help you determine the appropriate storage options and help you with data consistency.

ðŸ‘‰ App refactor aka create microservices: Write the code for each microservice, using the appropriate programming languages and frameworks for each. Make sure to follow best practices for writing scalable and secure microservices. Create multiple microservices for application, such as a user management service, a post management service, and a notifications service. Each service can be deployed in its own Amazon EC2 instance or using Amazon ECS or Amazon Fargate, depending on overall budget/needs.

ðŸ‘‰  MVP: Deploy and test the microservices: Deploy the microservices to the AWS environment and test them to make sure they work as expected. This will help you identify and resolve any issues before your application goes live.

ðŸ‘‰ Use Amazon SNS for notifications: To send notifications to users, use Amazon SNS to publish messages to multiple subscribers, such as email, SMS, and mobile push notifications

### For the CI/CD pipeline the following steps should be considered (thought the actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements of application):

ðŸ‘‰ Set up the AWS environment: Create an AWS account, Set up an Amazon S3 bucket to store the application code and artifacts, Create an Amazon EC2 instance or an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment to host the application

ðŸ‘‰ Write the Code: Write the code for your Twitter application and store it in a code repository like GitHub

ðŸ‘‰ Create a CodeBuild Project: Use AWS CodeBuild to automate the building and testing of code whenever a change is pushed to the repository

ðŸ‘‰ Create a CodePipeline: Use AWS CodePipeline to automate the deployment of your application since it integrates with CodeBuild and S3 to continuously delivering code from the Github repository to the production environment

ðŸ‘‰ Configure the CodePipeline Stages: The source stage pulls the code from the repository and stores it in S3 followed by the build stage uses CodeBuild to build and test the code sequenced by the deploy stage uses AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the code to the production environment

ðŸ‘‰ Test the Pipeline: Test the pipeline end-to-end to make sure it works as expected

ðŸ‘‰ Monitor the Pipeline: Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the pipeline and receive alerts in case of any issues
