# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture / Bootcamp Overview and Introduction to Cloud Spend
## Technical Tasks
In the class, we are going to lay out the foundation for the entire bootcamp by:
```
ðŸ‘‰ Discussing the format of the bootcamp
ðŸ‘‰ Going over the business use-case of our project
ðŸ‘‰ Looking at an architectural diagram of what we plan to build
ðŸ‘‰ Showcase how to use Lucid Charts to build architectures
ðŸ‘‰ Talk about C4 Models
ðŸ‘‰ Running through the cloud services we will utilize
ðŸ‘‰ Testing that we can access our AWS accounts
ðŸ‘‰ Settings up AWS free-tier and understand how to track spend in AWS --> eg . AWS Budgets, AWS Cost Explorer, Billing Alarms
ðŸ‘‰ Understanding how to look at monthly billing reports
ðŸ‘‰ Launching AWS CloudShell and looking at AWS CLI
ðŸ‘‰ Generating AWS credentials
```
## Business Scenario
```
Your company has asked to put together a technical presentation on the proposed architecture that will be implemented so it can be reviewed by the fractional CTO.

Your presentation must include a technical architectural diagram and breakdown of possible services used along with their justification.

The company also wants to generally know what spend we expect to encounter and how we will ensure we keep our spending low.
```
## Weekly Outcome
```
âœ… Gain confidence when working meter-billing with a Cloud Service Provider (CSP)
âœ… To understand how to build useful architecture diagrams
âœ… To gain a general idea of the cost of common cloud services
âœ… To ensure we have a working AWS account
```

## Homework Challenges 
``` 
âœ… Destroy your root account, Set MFA, IAM role
âœ… Set a billing alarm, Set a AWS Budget
âœ… Use EventBridge to hookup Health Dashboard to SNS and send notification when there is a service health issue.
âœ… Review all the questions of each pillars in the Well Architected Tool (No specialized lens)
âœ… Create an architectural diagram (to the best of your ability) the CI/CD logical pipeline in Lucid Charts
âœ… Research the technical and service limits of specific services and how they could impact the technical path for technical flexibility. 
âœ… Open a support ticket and request a service limit
